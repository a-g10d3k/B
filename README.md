# B
A simple, and quite useless program that changes all of your keyboard inputs to "B".
## Instructions
1. Run the executable.
2. Now you can't use your keyboard. Congratulations!
## FAQ
#### How the HECK do I make it stop!?
You need to either kill the process through the task manager or restart your computer.

#### I can't open the task manager!
That's because the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+Esc, and not B+B+B you dummy!
